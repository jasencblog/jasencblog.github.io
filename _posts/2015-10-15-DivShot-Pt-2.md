[Divshot][1]{:target="_blank"} has decided to merge with [Google's Firebase][2]{:target="_blank"}.

This is unfortunate news and as a result I need to get this blog off of Divshot.
The biggest reason is because for the same services I was getting for free,
I will now have to pay up to $15 a month. Well, $5 for this blog and an
additional $5 each for the other sites I was going to host using Divshot.

Perhaps it is time to revamp my entire web presence.

P.S. I finally took the time to figure out how to open new tabs off of links
using Markdown in Jekyll.
