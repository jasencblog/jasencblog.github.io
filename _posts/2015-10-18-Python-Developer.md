I'm going to focus on becoming a Python Developer. I've really taken the time to
figure out what I enjoy the most and as far as languages goes that would be
Python. I'm the most comfortable with it and the oppurtunities it brings excite
me more than the oppurtunities I've seen with other technologies. In other
words the careers are much more relatable to me and something I could really
see myself working on for a very long time.

The Python community has a culture that I enjoy. As far as using Python for web
development, I much prefer handling the magic myself. When I want some more
opinions than a design pattern I'll grab a JS framework to work with. Speaking
of that, it looks like React has a nice wrapper for Python - [react-python][1].
