I wanted to build a new application but I also wanted to implement TDD and use
Django. Enter [Test-Driven Development with Python][1] so graciously provided
free online by the OSCON Conference. It's been a joy to follow along with so far
and will continue to be a nice side project.

That is right, a side project. I've picked up another engineering contract
that should last until the end of the year. My GitHub is going to become fairly
less active as a result but hopefully I'll be able to string together some
active streaks.
