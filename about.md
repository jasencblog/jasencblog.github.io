### Hi, I'm Jasen Carroll.
Let's bring you up to speed.

I started programming in 2009 with a course in object oriented C++ and proceeded
to focus my mechanical engineering degree on robotics and controls. Afterwards I
gained professional experience working for a top Fortune 500 company. I've lived
a few places along the way but I'm currently happily residing in Portland, OR
while focusing my career on development. Web development has become a big part
of my life and my preferred language is Python, though I thuroughly believe in
using the right tool for the right job.

Feel free to email me or check out my [Github][1]{:target="_blank"}
repositories to see what I'm up to along the way. For my portfolio please go
