### Hi, I'm Jasen Carroll.
Let's bring you up to speed.

I started programming in 2009 with a course in object oriented C++ and proceeded
to focus my mechanical engineering degree on robotics and controls. Afterwards I
worked for a top performing Fortune 500 company for over two years then transistioned
from the Consumer industry to Medical Devices. I've lived a few places along the way
but I'm currently happily residing in Portland, OR while focusing my career on development.

I'm learning as I go and that's what this blog will be all about, hope you stay
tuned. Feel free to email me or check out my [Github][1](https://github.com/jasenc)
repositories to see what I'm up to along the way. For my portfolio please go
